## Usage

FIXME


## Development

### Run in DEV mode

```shell
lein run
```

### Build & Run

```shell
lein do clean, uberjar
java -jar {{name}}-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar -vf config/config.edn
```

The `-v` flag enables verbose mode - you can turn it off by specifying only `-f config/config.edn` in the CLI.

### REPL support

Start the REPL using `lein repl` command, which drops you into the `bract.dev.repl` namespace.

In the REPL you can run `(help)` command to see help.

### Running tests

Run the tests using `lein test` command. Application initialization is transparently finished before tests are run.
